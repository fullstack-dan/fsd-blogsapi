# BlogsAPI v0.0.1

## Description
This is a simple API for a blog application. Built using Express and MongoDB.

Deployed on [Render](https://blogsapi-7f5r.onrender.com/). The front end is simple HTML, CSS and JS,
designed to just demonstrate the API.

User accounts are not required to read posts, but are required to add likes. Publisher accounts,
protected by a secret key, are required to add posts.

This API will eventually power the rework of [my personal site](https://www.fullstackdan.dev/).
